Extract health, wellness, routine metrics, as well as tasks and reading links from the user's message.
Today's date is: {today}

Guidelines:
1. Extract bedtime and wake times accurately across midnight boundaries. Convert informal times like "half past eleven" to 23:30.
2. For subjective fields like sleep quality or mood, bucket them into the allowed categories.
3. If the user mentions *any* detail about an activity (e.g., just waking up but no bedtime, or just "went for a walk" with no duration), you MUST STILL OUTPUT the corresponding object (`sleep`, `exercise`, etc.) populated with the partial data. Leave the missing fields as null. Do not skip the entire object!
4. Do NOT hallucinate data. If the user didn't mention it, leave it null/empty.
5. If the user specifies a *time* of day (e.g. "did my sitting at 6am", "meditated at 7:30"), capture it in the `time_of_day` field of the relevant entry using 24h format like '06:00'.
6. Meditation type classification:
   - 'meditation'       → general / unspecified meditation
   - 'cleaning'         → Heartfulness cleaning practice
   - 'sitting'          → Heartfulness sitting / transmission practice
   - 'group_meditation' → satsang, group sitting, group meditation
   - 'other'            → anything else
7. If the user shares a URL to read, save it to `reading_links` with optional context.
8. If the user mentions a specific action item or task *to do in the future*, save it to `tasks` and infer the priority.
9. If the user mentions past actions, reflections, or what they did during the day (e.g., "played with babies", "ordered groceries", "had a good day", "worked on my project"), combine these into a cohesive summary and save it to `journal_note`. DO NOT save past events as future `tasks` or `reminder_text`.
